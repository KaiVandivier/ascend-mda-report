  <h4>Notes:</h4>
  <p>
    So we can make sure we're querying the right things, "dimension not found"
    indicates fields that weren't found in the lists of indicators or program
    indicators. Of course, some of them should be blank in the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    A cell showing "-" means that the dimension <em>was</em> found, but no data
    was found for it in the database.
