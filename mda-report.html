   * Row and cell definitions:
   * This is where to define the contents of cells in the table.
   *
   * The `dn` property is short for `dimensionName`: 
   * If you provide a dimension name, the dimension ID will be looked up and the cell value will be populated
   * according to the result of an analytics query.
   * Currently (17 July 2020), only Indicators and Program Indicators can be looked up by name,
   * but these can be expanded (see `getAllDimensions()`).
   *
   * To populate a cell with custom logic, provide a function for the `customLogic` property:
   * It will be called during table population with data. It should return the value that will be the final cell value.
   * The function receives its index and the current row of cells to use for calculations,
   * e.g. `customLogic: (idx, row) => { console.log(row[idx-1].value) }` -> Logs value of previous cell
   * `sumOf()` and `greatestOf()` are helper functions that may be useful for custom logic;
   * they receive any number of arguments and only operate on numbers, ignoring non-number cell values.
   *
   * You can also hard-code the value of the cell with the `value` property of the cell.
   * (But do not include a `dn` property if you want the value hard-coded)
